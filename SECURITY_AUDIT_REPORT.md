    function staleCheckLatestRoundData(AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed)
        public view returns (uint80, int256, uint256, uint256, uint80) {
        (uint80 roundId, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = 
            priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        
        uint256 secondsSince = block.timestamp - updatedAt;
        if (secondsSince > TIMEOUT) revert OracleLib__StalePrice();
        
        return (roundId, price, startedAt, updatedAt, answeredInRound);

## Critical Findings

### [C-1] Oracle Price Feed Validation Missing - Protocol Vulnerable to Stale or Invalid Price Data

**Description:** The `_getUsdValue` function directly uses Chainlink price feed data without proper validation. There are no checks for:
- Stale price data (last update time)
- Price feed heartbeat validation  
- Negative prices or zero prices
- Circuit breaker mechanism for extreme price movements

```solidity
function _getUsdValue(address token, uint256 amount) private view returns (uint256) {
    AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(s_priceFeeds[token]);
@>  (, int256 price,,,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
    return ((uint256(price) * ADDITIONAL_FEED_PRECISION) * amount) / PRECISION;
}
```

**Impact:** 
- Attackers could exploit stale price data during market volatility
- Users could be liquidated unfairly due to incorrect pricing
- Protocol could become insolvent if prices are manipulated or corrupted
- Zero or negative prices could break liquidation mechanics

**Proof of Concept:**
1. Price feed becomes stale during network congestion
2. Attacker uses old favorable prices to mint excessive DSC
3. When prices update, protocol becomes severely undercollateralized
4. Legitimate users suffer losses while attacker profits

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive price validation:

```diff
function _getUsdValue(address token, uint256 amount) private view returns (uint256) {
    AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(s_priceFeeds[token]);
-   (, int256 price,,,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
+   (uint80 roundId, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
+   
+   // Check for stale price
+   require(updatedAt > 0, "DSCEngine: Price data not updated");
+   require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= PRICE_STALENESS_THRESHOLD, "DSCEngine: Stale price data");
+   
+   // Check for valid price
+   require(price > 0, "DSCEngine: Invalid price");
+   require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "DSCEngine: Price data incomplete");
+   
    return ((uint256(price) * ADDITIONAL_FEED_PRECISION) * amount) / PRECISION;
}
```

---

## High Severity Findings

### [H-1] Liquidation Bonus Calculation Creates Arbitrage Opportunities and Protocol Drain Risk

**Description:** The liquidation mechanism provides a flat 10% bonus regardless of how much of the user's debt is being covered. This creates several issues:

1. **Partial Liquidation Abuse:** Liquidators can repeatedly liquidate small amounts to maximize bonus extraction
2. **Protocol Value Leakage:** The 10% bonus is taken from protocol collateral, not from liquidated user's excess collateral
3. **Arbitrage Exploitation:** Liquidators can time liquidations to maximize profit during price volatility

```solidity
function liquidate(address collateral, address user, uint256 debtToCover) external {
    // ... validation checks ...
    uint256 tokenAmountFromDebtCovered = getTokenAmountFromUsd(collateral, debtToCover);
@>  uint256 bonusCollateral = (tokenAmountFromDebtCovered * LIQUIDATION_BONUS) / LIQUIDATION_PRECISION;
    _redeemCollateral(collateral, tokenAmountFromDebtCovered + bonusCollateral, user, msg.sender);
    _burnDsc(debtToCover, user, msg.sender);
}
```

**Impact:**
- Protocol loses 10% value on every liquidation through bonus payments
- Users face higher liquidation penalties than necessary
- Incentivizes partial liquidations over full liquidations
- Could lead to protocol insolvency during market stress

**Proof of Concept:**
1. User becomes liquidatable with $1000 debt and $1500 collateral
2. Liquidator liquidates $100 debt, receives $110 collateral value
3. User still liquidatable, liquidator repeats process
4. Protocol pays excessive bonuses while user loses more than necessary

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement proportional bonus calculation and caps:

```diff
function liquidate(address collateral, address user, uint256 debtToCover) external {
    // ... existing validation ...
    uint256 tokenAmountFromDebtCovered = getTokenAmountFromDebtCovered(collateral, debtToCover);
-   uint256 bonusCollateral = (tokenAmountFromDebtCovered * LIQUIDATION_BONUS) / LIQUIDATION_PRECISION;
+   
+   // Calculate proportional bonus based on liquidation percentage
+   uint256 userTotalDebt = s_DSCMinted[user];
+   uint256 liquidationPercentage = (debtToCover * LIQUIDATION_PRECISION) / userTotalDebt;
+   uint256 maxBonusPercentage = liquidationPercentage > 50 ? LIQUIDATION_BONUS : LIQUIDATION_BONUS / 2;
+   uint256 bonusCollateral = (tokenAmountFromDebtCovered * maxBonusPercentage) / LIQUIDATION_PRECISION;
+   
+   // Cap bonus to avoid protocol drain
+   uint256 userCollateralValue = getAccountCollateralValue(user);
+   uint256 maxBonus = (userCollateralValue - userTotalDebt) / 4; // Max 25% of excess collateral
+   bonusCollateral = bonusCollateral > maxBonus ? maxBonus : bonusCollateral;
}
```

### [H-2] Missing Access Control on Critical Functions Allows Unauthorized Operations

**Description:** Several critical functions lack proper access control mechanisms:

1. **Constructor Parameters:** No validation that price feed addresses are valid contracts
2. **Token Support:** No mechanism to add/remove supported collateral tokens after deployment
3. **Emergency Controls:** No pause mechanism or emergency withdrawal capabilities
4. **Price Feed Updates:** No way to update price feeds if Chainlink contracts change

**Impact:**
- Deployment with invalid price feeds could brick the contract
- No flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions
- No emergency response capabilities during protocol threats
- Potential permanent loss of funds if price feeds fail

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add proper access control and emergency mechanisms:

```solidity
// Add these imports and inheritance
import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import {Pausable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Pausable.sol";

contract DSCEngine is ReentrancyGuard, Ownable, Pausable {
    
    function addCollateralToken(address token, address priceFeed) external onlyOwner {
        require(token != address(0), "DSCEngine: Invalid token address");
        require(priceFeed != address(0), "DSCEngine: Invalid price feed");
        require(s_priceFeeds[token] == address(0), "DSCEngine: Token already supported");
        
        s_priceFeeds[token] = priceFeed;
        s_collateralTokens.push(token);
    }
    
    function updatePriceFeed(address token, address newPriceFeed) external onlyOwner {
        require(s_priceFeeds[token] != address(0), "DSCEngine: Token not supported");
        require(newPriceFeed != address(0), "DSCEngine: Invalid price feed");
        
        s_priceFeeds[token] = newPriceFeed;
    }
    
    function emergencyPause() external onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }
    
    function emergencyUnpause() external onlyOwner {
        _unpause();
    }
}
```

## Medium Severity Findings

### [M-1] Health Factor Calculation Precision Loss Can Lead to Incorrect Liquidations

**Description:** The `_calculateHealthFactor` function performs division before multiplication in the return statement, which can lead to precision loss in Solidity. This was partially addressed but the issue pattern exists elsewhere in the codebase.

```solidity
function _calculateHealthFactor(uint256 totalDscMinted, uint256 collateralValueInUsd) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (totalDscMinted == 0) return type(uint256).max;
    // Recently fixed to multiply before divide, but pattern exists elsewhere
    return (collateralValueInUsd * LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD * PRECISION) / (LIQUIDATION_PRECISION * totalDscMinted);
}
```

**Impact:**
- Users could be liquidated incorrectly due to precision errors
- Health factor calculations could be inaccurate
- Edge cases with small amounts could break protocol mechanics

**Recommended Mitigation:** Audit all mathematical operations for precision loss and implement proper rounding:

```solidity
// Add precision-safe math library
library PrecisionMath {
    function mulDiv(uint256 a, uint256 b, uint256 c) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return (a * b) / c;
    }
    
    function mulDivRoundUp(uint256 a, uint256 b, uint256 c) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return (a * b + c - 1) / c;
    }
}
```

### [M-2] Lack of Slippage Protection in Liquidations During High Volatility

**Description:** The liquidation function doesn't account for price slippage between the time a liquidation is initiated and when it's executed. During high volatility, prices can move significantly, affecting liquidation fairness.

**Impact:**
- Liquidators could profit from favorable price movements
- Users could be liquidated at worse prices than expected
- MEV bots could sandwich liquidation transactions

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement slippage protection and price impact limits:

```solidity
function liquidate(
    address collateral, 
    address user, 
    uint256 debtToCover,
    uint256 minCollateralReceived // Add slippage protection
) external {
    // ... existing checks ...
    uint256 tokenAmountFromDebtCovered = getTokenAmountFromUsd(collateral, debtToCover);
    uint256 bonusCollateral = (tokenAmountFromDebtCovered * LIQUIDATION_BONUS) / LIQUIDATION_PRECISION;
    uint256 totalCollateralToReceive = tokenAmountFromDebtCovered + bonusCollateral;
    
    require(totalCollateralToReceive >= minCollateralReceived, "DSCEngine: Slippage too high");
    
    // ... rest of function
}
```

### [M-3] Centralization Risk with Single Point of Failure in Price Feeds

**Description:** The protocol relies on single Chainlink price feeds for each asset without fallback mechanisms. If a price feed fails, becomes deprecated, or is manipulated, the entire protocol for that asset becomes unusable.

**Impact:**
- Single point of failure for each supported asset
- No graceful degradation if price feeds fail
- Potential for oracle manipulation attacks
- Protocol could become permanently broken for specific assets

**Recommended Mitigation:** Implement multiple oracle sources and fallback mechanisms:

```solidity
struct PriceFeedConfig {
    address primaryFeed;
    address secondaryFeed;
    uint256 maxDeviation; // Maximum allowed deviation between feeds
    uint256 heartbeat; // Maximum staleness tolerance
}

mapping(address => PriceFeedConfig) private s_priceFeedConfigs;

function _getUsdValueWithFallback(address token, uint256 amount) private view returns (uint256) {
    PriceFeedConfig memory config = s_priceFeedConfigs[token];
    
    try this._getPriceFromFeed(config.primaryFeed) returns (uint256 primaryPrice) {
        try this._getPriceFromFeed(config.secondaryFeed) returns (uint256 secondaryPrice) {
            // Compare prices and ensure they're within acceptable deviation
            uint256 deviation = primaryPrice > secondaryPrice ? 
                ((primaryPrice - secondaryPrice) * PRECISION) / primaryPrice :
                ((secondaryPrice - primaryPrice) * PRECISION) / secondaryPrice;
                
            require(deviation <= config.maxDeviation, "DSCEngine: Price deviation too high");
            return ((primaryPrice * ADDITIONAL_FEED_PRECISION) * amount) / PRECISION;
        } catch {
            // Secondary failed, use primary only
            return ((primaryPrice * ADDITIONAL_FEED_PRECISION) * amount) / PRECISION;
        }
    } catch {
        // Primary failed, try secondary
        uint256 secondaryPrice = this._getPriceFromFeed(config.secondaryFeed);
        return ((secondaryPrice * ADDITIONAL_FEED_PRECISION) * amount) / PRECISION;
    }
}
```

## Low Severity Findings

### [L-1] Lack of Input Validation in Constructor

**Description:** The constructor doesn't validate that the provided addresses are actual contracts or that they implement the expected interfaces.

```solidity
constructor(address[] memory tokenAddresses, address[] memory priceFeedAddresses, address dscAddress) {
    if (tokenAddresses.length != priceFeedAddresses.length) {
        revert DSCEngine__TokenAddressesAndPriceFeedAddressesAmountsDontMatch();
    }
    // No validation that addresses are contracts
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenAddresses.length; i++) {
        s_priceFeeds[tokenAddresses[i]] = priceFeedAddresses[i];
        s_collateralTokens.push(tokenAddresses[i]);
    }
    i_dsc = DecentralizedStableCoin(dscAddress);
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add contract validation:

```diff
+ import {Address} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";

constructor(address[] memory tokenAddresses, address[] memory priceFeedAddresses, address dscAddress) {
    if (tokenAddresses.length != priceFeedAddresses.length) {
        revert DSCEngine__TokenAddressesAndPriceFeedAddressesAmountsDontMatch();
    }
+   require(Address.isContract(dscAddress), "DSCEngine: DSC address must be contract");
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenAddresses.length; i++) {
+       require(Address.isContract(tokenAddresses[i]), "DSCEngine: Token address must be contract");
+       require(Address.isContract(priceFeedAddresses[i]), "DSCEngine: Price feed must be contract");
        s_priceFeeds[tokenAddresses[i]] = priceFeedAddresses[i];
        s_collateralTokens.push(tokenAddresses[i]);
    }
    i_dsc = DecentralizedStableCoin(dscAddress);
}
```

### [L-2] Missing Events for Critical State Changes

**Description:** Several critical functions don't emit events, making it difficult to track important protocol changes off-chain.

**Functions missing events:**
- `mintDsc` - should emit DSC minting events
- `burnDsc` - should emit DSC burning events  
- `liquidate` - needs more comprehensive liquidation events

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add comprehensive event emissions:

```solidity
event DSCMinted(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
event DSCBurned(address indexed user, uint256 amount);
event LiquidationExecuted(
    address indexed liquidator,
    address indexed user,
    address indexed collateral,
    uint256 debtCovered,
    uint256 collateralLiquidated,
    uint256 bonus
);
```

---

## Gas Optimization Findings

### [G-1] State Variables Should Be Declared Immutable When Possible

**Description:** Several state variables are set once in the constructor and never modified, but aren't declared as `immutable`.

**Instances:**
- `i_dsc` is correctly immutable
- Constants like `LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD`, `LIQUIDATION_BONUS` etc. are correctly constant

**Current implementation is already optimized.**

### [G-2] Unnecessary Storage Reads in Loops

**Description:** The `getAccountCollateralValue` function reads from storage in a loop without caching the array length.

```solidity
function getAccountCollateralValue(address user) public view returns (uint256 totalCollateralValueInUsd) {
    for (uint256 index = 0; index < s_collateralTokens.length; index++) {
        address token = s_collateralTokens[index];
        uint256 amount = s_collateralDeposited[user][token];
        totalCollateralValueInUsd += _getUsdValue(token, amount);
    }
    return totalCollateralValueInUsd;
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**

```diff
function getAccountCollateralValue(address user) public view returns (uint256 totalCollateralValueInUsd) {
+   uint256 tokensLength = s_collateralTokens.length;
-   for (uint256 index = 0; index < s_collateralTokens.length; index++) {
+   for (uint256 index = 0; index < tokensLength; index++) {
        address token = s_collateralTokens[index];
        uint256 amount = s_collateralDeposited[user][token];
        totalCollateralValueInUsd += _getUsdValue(token, amount);
    }
    return totalCollateralValueInUsd;
}
```

### [G-3] Redundant Health Factor Check in `burnDsc`

**Description:** The `burnDsc` function calls `_revertIfHealthFactorIsBroken` after burning DSC, but burning DSC should only improve the health factor.

```solidity
function burnDsc(uint256 amount) external moreThanZero(amount) {
    _burnDsc(amount, msg.sender, msg.sender);
    _revertIfHealthFactorIsBroken(msg.sender); // Unnecessary check
}
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**

```diff
function burnDsc(uint256 amount) external moreThanZero(amount) {
    _burnDsc(amount, msg.sender, msg.sender);
-   _revertIfHealthFactorIsBroken(msg.sender);
}
```

---

## Informational Findings

### [I-1] Solidity Version Specification

**Description:** The contract uses `pragma solidity ^0.8.20;` which allows any version above 0.8.20. Consider using a specific version for production deployments.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
```diff
- pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
+ pragma solidity 0.8.20;
```

### [I-2] Missing NatSpec Documentation

**Description:** Several functions lack comprehensive NatSpec documentation, particularly internal and private functions.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add complete NatSpec documentation for all functions:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Calculates the health factor for a user
 * @param totalDscMinted The total amount of DSC minted by the user
 * @param collateralValueInUsd The total USD value of user's collateral
 * @return The calculated health factor (scaled by 1e18)
 */
function _calculateHealthFactor(uint256 totalDscMinted, uint256 collateralValueInUsd) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (totalDscMinted == 0) return type(uint256).max;
    return (collateralValueInUsd * LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD * PRECISION) / (LIQUIDATION_PRECISION * totalDscMinted);
}
```

### [I-3] Magic Numbers Should Be Named Constants

**Description:** Several magic numbers appear throughout the code without clear meaning.

**Instances:**
- `50` for `LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD` âœ“ (Already properly named)
- `10` for `LIQUIDATION_BONUS` âœ“ (Already properly named)
- `100` for `LIQUIDATION_PRECISION` âœ“ (Already properly named)

**Current implementation is already following best practices.**

### [I-4] Consider Adding Circuit Breaker Mechanisms

**Description:** The protocol would benefit from circuit breaker mechanisms during extreme market conditions.

**Recommended Enhancement:**
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_PRICE_DEVIATION = 2000; // 20%
uint256 public constant CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD = 5000; // 50%

modifier circuitBreakerCheck(address token) {
    uint256 currentPrice = _getUsdValue(token, 1e18);
    uint256 recentPrice = getRecentAveragePrice(token);
    
    if (recentPrice > 0) {
        uint256 deviation = currentPrice > recentPrice ?
            ((currentPrice - recentPrice) * 10000) / recentPrice :
            ((recentPrice - currentPrice) * 10000) / recentPrice;
            
        require(deviation <= CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD, "DSCEngine: Circuit breaker triggered");
    }
    _;
}
```

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required (Critical/High)
1. **Implement comprehensive price feed validation** with staleness checks and circuit breakers
2. **Add proper access control** with owner capabilities and emergency mechanisms  
3. **Fix liquidation bonus calculation** to prevent protocol value drainage
4. **Implement oracle fallback mechanisms** to prevent single points of failure

### Medium Priority Improvements
1. Add slippage protection to liquidation functions
2. Implement more granular health factor calculations
3. Add comprehensive event emissions for off-chain monitoring

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Consider implementing a governance mechanism for protocol upgrades
2. Add yield-generating strategies for idle collateral
3. Implement cross-chain compatibility for broader adoption
4. Consider adding insurance mechanisms for edge case scenarios

## Conclusion

The DSCEngine contract demonstrates a solid foundation for a decentralized stablecoin protocol with proper use of established security patterns. However, the identified critical and high-severity issues pose significant risks to protocol security and user funds. 

**The contract should not be deployed to mainnet without addressing at least all Critical and High severity findings.**

The most pressing concerns are around oracle security, liquidation mechanisms, and access control. Once these issues are resolved and properly tested, the protocol should be suitable for production deployment with appropriate monitoring and emergency response procedures in place.

**Estimated Development Time for Fixes:** 2-3 weeks for critical/high issues, plus comprehensive testing.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Address all critical and high severity findings
2. Implement comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
3. Conduct additional security review focused on oracle security
4. Perform stress testing under extreme market conditions
5. Set up proper monitoring and alerting infrastructure
